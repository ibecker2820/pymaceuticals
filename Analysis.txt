The first thing that we can tell about this test is that the samples were taken as good representations of both a consistent amount of mice being tested
using each drug and the amount of male and female mice in the total test. This is important for drug testing to make sure there are aren't and biases.

The second observation we should take is looking at the outliers in each of the different drugs at the end of the tests. Infubinol is the only test with
with an outlier. We should investigate why this outlier might be there.

The final obervation is that we can tell Capomulin has an effect on tumor volume as it is used. The volume of the tumor in mm3 goes down around %50 at the
end of the trial. This is a significant decrease. It should be further compared against other mice using the same drug. We should also look at how this 
compares to other drugs.
